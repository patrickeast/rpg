# Both Assignments

I started out on this homework assignment by working through the RPG scenario. After talking to my tutor and Jeff (TA) about it, I decided to let it sit for another week and come back to work through the bugs when I have a clear head. I submitted both assignments for that reason. I would love feedback on both, only if you have the time. I'll talk about both below.

# RPG Assignment

A big issue I ran into with the RPG assignment was not testing my code frequently while writing it. I switched my psuedo-coding process around this time, opting to work through placements and logic as I wrote the HTML and CSS, instead of writing out what I would do in a separate document. I now know that I need to do both, simultaneously, as I create the JS. I wrote out long chunks of code without testing, mainly trying to complete each section before going through and testing for bugs. By the time I tested, the errors were too embedded. I feel like I'm _95%_ there. 

# Crystals Assignment

Deciding to take a break on the RPG assignment and work on the Crystals Assignment helped me immensely. I was able to work through the assignment much quicker, going through the logic problems easier, since I struggled through them for hours on end with the RPF assignment.

#After thoughts

I'm really excited to go back through the RPG assignment and find those bugs! I built animations for my illustrated characters, and I'm excited to show off the final product when it is finished.

#Thanks for reading.
